rayguy *will be* an easy to use and simple library for games that make use of raycasting.
Currently it is in a very experimental stage, it isn't even a library yet.

I have been following the [cgtutor tutorial](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) to create the raycaster logic.

After I am done implementing all of the necessary features, I will start to work on the library and (possibly) the editor.
